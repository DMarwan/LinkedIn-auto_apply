# Linkedin-AutoApply
A small code snippet that I made in order to get a job.

Requierements : selenium, Chromedriver stable release.

HOW TO : 

from scrape_linkedin import * 
scraper(mail, password, job, location) #replace the arguments

PS : Use it at your own risk, I am not responsible for any account ban from LinkedIn. (even if that's not illegal, of course)
